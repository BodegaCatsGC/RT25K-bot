# iOS App (SwiftUI)

This folder contains a lightweight SwiftUI application used to test RT25K bot functionality on iOS.

The app provides simple login, configuration, and home screens. It fetches standings from Google Sheets and tournament data from Challonge. Networking is implemented with `URLSession` and runs on async/await.

Open the project in Xcode and run on a simulator or device. There are no automated tests.
